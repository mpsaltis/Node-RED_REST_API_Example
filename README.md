## 1️⃣ Building an IO Control Dashboard

In one flow I show dashboard I built to control the inputs and outputs on the CC100. It’s a simple yet powerful way to visualize the state of the IO onboard this controller.

## 2️⃣ Integrating REST APIs with Node-RED (College Football 🏈 and F1 Rankings 🏎️ )

The second two flows takes a fun twist—showing how easy it is to work with REST APIs in Node-RED. With the 2024 seasons wrapping up, I pulled week by week College Football rankings into a Node-RED dashboard. Combining industrial automation with sports data was a blast, and a great way to show how REST API's with Node-RED might be used in industrial applications.
