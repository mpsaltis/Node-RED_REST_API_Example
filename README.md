# Node-RED_REST_API_Example
With the 2024 seasons wrapping up, I pulled week by week College Football rankings and Formula 1 points standings into a Node-RED dashboard. Combining industrial automation with sports data was a blast, and a great way to show how REST API's with Node-RED might be used in industrial applications.

With 2024 coming to a close, I spent an afternoon creating two fun examples using Node-RED on the WAGO CC100 controller. 

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Building an IO Control Dashboard

In the first video, I show dashboard I built to control the inputs and outputs on the CC100. It‚Äôs a simple yet powerful way to visualize the state of the IO onboard this controller.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Integrating REST APIs with Node-RED (College Football üèà and F1 Rankings üèéÔ∏è )

The second video takes a fun twist‚Äîshowing how easy it is to work with REST APIs in Node-RED. With the 2024 seasons wrapping up, I pulled week by week College Football rankings and Formula 1 points standings into a Node-RED dashboard. Combining industrial automation with sports data was a blast, and a great way to show how REST API's with Node-RED might be used in industrial applications.
